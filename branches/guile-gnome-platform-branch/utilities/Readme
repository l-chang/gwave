Most of the utilities here are related to document and init-string
extraction from C source code.

gwave-doc-snarf.scm - 
extract embedded documentation from the output of
the C preprocessor run on C code that uses the xsnarf.h macros
(a rewrite of guile-snarf.awk in guile)

doc-split.scm - split a file of mixed documentation fragments into
four files, one each for procedures, concepts, hooks, and variables.
(a rewrite of the perl doc-split)
