ability to get wave data from guile
	(wavevar-value x) - return value at x-coord.
	what else? how to expose the structure of wavevars?

survey existing guile primitives and add new ones to fill out a useful set
for scripting in general, not just what the GUI offers at the moment.

overhaul plotting
	move mostly into scheme
	keep "wave data export" function in C, make availble in guile
	dialog box for options

move to top, move to bottom to alter drawing order for visiblewaves in panel

custom measurements

waveform calculations
	- display-functions of a single wavevar and scalars
	- display-functions of wavevars sharing the same independent var
	- more general stuff that computes a new wavevar

Y zoom methods:
	manual: type in min and max for panel DONE
	automatic-global: (original)
	automatic-window: alway show min, max in current window zoom extents
	oneshot-global: compute min,max when clicked, not continually.
	oneshot-window: 

documentation
	docstring extraction from guile
	get reference-manual auto-generation working
	write some introductory text to hold the auto-generated parts together

example guile scripts for useful functions

draw a real graticule in wave panels

"envelope" drawing algorithm (that doesn't alias when too many
datapoints for current zoom) 
Add an indication that there may be too many points on screen (simply
look at number of ivar points vs. number of pixels)

additional drawing styles
	linestyles - dashed, etc.
	symbols showing actual datapoints
	a means to highlight selected visiblewaves - draw with thicker lines?

prevent switching to log-scale if the axis includes 0 or negative values.
