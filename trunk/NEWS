Gwave NEWS --- history of user-visible changes.  -*- text -*-

New in 0.0.6:
- Inserting/deleting waveform panels.
- added right-button popup menu to waveform panels
- The compile/install process now uses automake and autoconf to generate
  the familiar "configure" script
- An attempt at placing the variable list windows in a more convenient position
in relation to the main window.  Getting this perfect under all window managers
is a losing proposition.

New in 0.0.5:
- Fixed bug in reading hspice files with lots of columns
- displays signal name list window for files read from the command line.
  (note: it will probably be behind the main window)
- incorporated code contributed by Jeff Dionne for reading spice2 rawfiles

New in 0.0.4:
- Fixed bug and/or warning when first waveform is added to display
- Ability to drag vertical bar cursors around, in addition to click-to-place
- Added zoom-to-cursor function; if both cursors have been placed,
	zooms so that the time between the cursors fills the display.
- Added zoom-to-window function.  Select this menu option, then
	press/drag/release mouse button 1 to indicate a region of the X
	axis that then zooms to fill the display.

New in 0.0.3:
- Load multiple files at once, either from the command line or 
interactively.
- Some operations are moved to pulldown menus.
