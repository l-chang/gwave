Installation:
	Edit the top of the makefile if necessary
	Compile with GNU make.
	test gwave on some files in the examples directory
	Copy the "gwave" binary to your favorite bin

Usage:
wave [-t filetype] [-p number-of-panels] your-waveform-file

Number-of-panels defaults to 2.  It understands CAzM transient output
(.N/.B/.W) files, and the binary and ascii outputs from HSPICE (.tr0,
.sw0, and .ac0) files.  
If the file type is unspecified, it tries to guess
based on filename, and then tries all file formats until one succedes.

Use the View->Variable List menu to see a list of a list of signals in
your simulation files, then drag-and-drop signals into waveform
panels.

To delete waves, select one or more of them using the buttons down the
left side of the main window, and then press the "delete" button.

Click on the waveform panels with the left and center mouse buttons to set two
cursors for measuring.  Hold down these mouse buttons to drag the cursors.

Pressing and holding the right mouse button while the cursor is in a
waveform panel brings up a popup menu.  From this menu you can insert
and delete waveform panels.  Some of the zoom commands are also
replicated on this menu.


Known problems:
- HSPICE data files generated without ".options probe" may not be read
correctly. workaround: try using ".options probe".  This mostly happens with
AC sweeps.

This tool is far from complete. Partial contents of the To Do list:

- Send feedback and error messages from loading of files to a popup window
  or status line instead of to stdout.
- Drag-and-drop to move waveform from one panel to another
- Logarithmic X and Y axes
- Speed up redraws and minimize flashing, especialy flashing 
  of waveform name/value labels when moving cursors.
- Generate a postscript representation for printing or documentation.
- Override of wave and panel paramters, like min/max Y value, color, etc.
- Saving and restoring waveform/panel configuration 
- Drawing a labeled graticule in the waveform area
- Seperate lists for selecting voltage/current/etc. types of variables
- Clean up reader code by collecting some idioms that appear again and again
  into common subroutines.  This will make writing new readers a little easier.
