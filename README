Installation:
	Edit the top of the makefile if necessary
	Compile with GNU make.
	test gwave on some files in the examples directory
	Copy the "gwave" binary to your favorite bin

Usage:
wave [-t filetype] [-p number-of-panels] your-waveform-file

Number-of-panels defaults to 2.  It understands CAzM transient output
(.N/.B/.W) files, and the binary and ascii outputs from HSPICE (.tr0,
.sw0, and .ac0) files.  
If the file type is unspecified, it tries to guess
based on filename, and then tries all file formats until one succedes.

Use the View->Variable List menu to see a list of a list of signals in
your simulation files, then drag-and-drop signals into waveform
panels.

To delete waves, select one or more of them using the buttons down the
left side of the main window, and then press the "delete" button.

Click on the waveform panels with the left and center mouse buttons to set two
cursors for measuring.


New in 0.3:
- Load multiple files at once, either from the command line or 
interactively.
- Some operations are moved to pulldown menus.


Known problems:
- When a signal is added, it may not get drawn immediately.
  use your window-manager refresh or simply cover and uncover the gwave
  window, or do a zoom in/out.
- HSPICE data files generated without ".options probe" are not read
correctly. workaround: always use ".options probe".


This tool is far from complete. Partial contents of the To Do list:

Interactively changing the number of panels
Drag-and-drop to move waveform from one panel to another
Logarithmic X and Y axes
Ability to drag vertical bar cursors around, in addition to click-to-place
Speed up redraws, especialy placing of the cursors
Generate a postscript representation for printing or documentation.
Override of wave and panel paramters, like min/max Y value, color, etc.
Saving and restoring waveform/panel configuration 
Drawing a labeled graticule in the waveform area
Seperate lists for selecting voltage/current/etc. types of variables
