Installation:
	Edit the top of the makefile if necessary
	Compile with GNU make.
	test gwave on some files in the examples directory
	Copy the "gwave" binary to your favorite bin

Usage:
wave [-t filetype] [-p number-of-panels] your-waveform-file

Number-of-panels defaults to 2.  It understands CAzM transient output
(.N/.B/.W) files, and ascii-format output from HSPICE (.tr0, .sw0, and
.ac0) files.  Generate your hspice output with ".options POST=2 .graph ..."
If the file type is unspecified, it tries to guess based on
filename, and then tries all file formats until one succedes.

Click on the "variables" button to see a list of signals in your
simulation output, then drag-and-drop signals into waveform panels.

To delete waves, select using the buttons down the left side of the
main window, and then press the "delete" button.

Click on the waveform panels with the left and center mouse buttons to set two
cursors for measuring.

Known problems:
- When a signal is added, it may not get drawn immediately.
  use your window-manager refresh or simply cover and uncover the gwave
  window.
- When deleting a signal, a bunch of messages get spewed to stderr,
- Only one signal is deleted for each click of the delete button.


This tool is far from complete. Partial contents of the To Do list:

Interactively changing the number of panels
Load multiple files for comparison
Drag-and-drop to move waveform from one panel to another
Logarithmic X and Y axes
Ability to drag vertical bar cursors around, in addition to click-to-place
Speed up redraws, especialy placing of the cursors
generate a postscript representation for printing or documentation
Override of wave and panel paramters, like min/max Y value, color, etc.
Saving and restoring waveform/panel configuration 
Drawing a labeled graticule in the waveform area
Seperate lists for selecting voltage/current/etc. types of variables
